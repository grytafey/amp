Automated Materials Production

The Automated Material Production process, or A.M.P., allows advocates to make multi-media materials, including paper hand-outs, videos, presentations for meetings, an audio file, and a workbook, from a spreadsheet or an outline in Word.  A.M.P. guides an advocate to make effective, useful multimedia materials for clients without special graphic design knowledge or video production skills, while providing the ability to customize information to the client's specific jursidiction.

A.M.P. uses a
  
##Design Principles
*Creates multimedia educational materials to meet the different needs of our client population
*Hand-outs match videos and presentation, providing a reminder clients can take with them
*Easy to change and update all multimedia at once, based on feedback or changes in law
*Breaks multimedia production tasks into simple roles
*Provides the foundation for future projects to allow more personalized, usefuul educational materials

Each page of the User Guide will walk you through one step of A.M.P.:
1. Outline Content and Pick Template
2. Pick images and/or documents
3. Add Template Tags and names of images to Outline
4. Record Script Based on Presentation
5. Add Images, Animations and Videos

##Using A.M.P. Individually & Collaboratively
The A.M.P. process can both help individual advocates work on multimedia materials individually and can be used in community meetings to help advocates, community partners and clients to create materials collaboratively.

#Step 1 – Outline Content & Pick Template
The hardest part of creating legal educational materials is organizing the information you want to convey to your audience, no matter what process you use.  The outline in A.M.P. is the one document that will be shared, edited, updated, and corrected among your team,
###Most Important Guides
1. We understand and remember information when presented in groups of no more than 3-4 parts.  Outlining and the templates help us organize our content into these groups.
2. Layer information: Assume people only read titles. If they then have a question about the title, they look to the text for an answer.  In voice-over and in the workbook, we can introduce examples and humanity.  The most simple version of layers used by the templates is a Title with a Titletext underneath. 
3. Use Plain English.  There will be an opportunity to review and improve Plain English later, as well.
How-to
a) Review Library Templates
First, look through the library of templates to get ideas about how to organize your content.  The library of Templates is available on the G drive.
Here are some exAMPles:
                 
The Templates use a number of different methods to organize and present information. Think about which of these methods can help you organize your content.
-Lists
-Process of steps
-Tips in handwriting
-Sidebyside comparisons
-Document help
-Question and Answers
-Side box of Definitions
b) Make Your Content Into an Outline 
Write a Multilevel List in Microsoft Word.  Pick this list --->  
The organization of the outline isn’t that important.  For A.M.P., all that matters is each block of text has its own number in the outline.  Organize the outline in a way that makes sense to you and your collaborators
You can start with a pre-formatted outline, with Template Tags.  Here is an outline for the second template from the right.  Here is that outline filled in with content.

###Microsoft Word Tips for Outlining
-Check “Navigation Pane” in the “View” menu to use a collapsible outline.
-Change Autocorrect settings to check Set left and first indent with tab and backspace.  

####If a Template Doesn’t Quite Fit...
If none of the Templates are exactly right for the way you want to organize your information, you can request a new Template from an A.M.P. Producer.  It is not difficult to customize the Templates, especially if you are adding another bullet point to a list or combining different organizational methods.  

#Step 2 – Pick images and/or documents

A.M.P. uses simple icons as images in the hand-out and video.  These are standard images with a common design element that make the hand-out more readable and connect the hand-out to other multimedia materials.  There will be a chance to add photographs and fun pictures to the video later!

###Most Important Guides
Images are to aid in literacy, adds emphasis, break-up text on a hand-out, and create links and connections across materials.  
Documents and forms can increase familiarity if clients can recognize similar notices they’ve received.
How-to
a) Pick images from library and make list
You can find the library of images here on the G drive.  You want to use the library of square images.
Here are some sample images from the library.

Pick an image that emphasizes the information next to the image on the template.
The template will have names on the picture holders like Pic1, Pic2, and so on
Make a list starting with the name, then a semicolon, then “images\” then finally the name of the image you are selecting.  For example,
Pic1;images\baby.png
Pic2;images\BuildingBlocksPlanV.png
Pic3;images\dressshirt.png
Pic4;images\house.png
Pic5;images\monthday15.png
Pic6;images\Scales.png  *Pay attention to capital letters!
Pic7;images\thumbsup.png
If the template you picked has picture holders that do not have names, email an AMP Producer to update the template.
b) Find appropriate documents
Some templates allow you to use a document in the hand-out and the rest of the materials.  Find a document that the client may have received, or a form that the client may have to use.  For example, this template could use a document of a notice of a reduction in benefits.
c) Find any personal information in the documents to retract
If you use a client’s document as a sample, of course we don’t want any personal information on the document!  Double check to make sure there is no personal information in the document.  Make a note about the personal information to send to the A.M.P. Producer to redact.
d) Send list & documents to an A.M.P. Producer to convert to an image file
Can’t find an image that you need?
If the library doesn’t have an image that you can need, you can email an A.M.P. Producer and request an image.  
You can also search for an image yourself by using Google.  After searching for something on Google, click on Images, then click on “Search Tools”  Click on “Type” and select “Clip Art” from the drop-down menu.  Next, click on “Search Tools” and check “Labeled for non-commercial reuse with modification” or any of the other options other than “Not filtered by license”
If you find an image you like, email the web address where you found the image to an A.M.P. Producer.
Step 3 – Add Template Tags to Outline

Not Used for Collaborative Meetings
Step 3 is intended for individual use of A.M.P.  In a collaborative meeting, this step can be done by an A.M.P. Producer and does not need to have time dedicated to it during the meeting.  (Unless all or most of the attendees will use A.M.P. individually.)
Most Important Guide
Please provide feedback about how easy the process is to use.  The whole point is to make it easy to use A.M.P.  There are other methods we could use, using spreadsheets, Google Forms, or A2J Author Interviews.  Microsoft Word was used because it is the most commonly used program.

How to
a) Find Template Tags in the Template you Chose.
Each line or block of text says the Template Tag for that block.  For lines, such as titles, the Template Tag is usually typed once.  When your text gets plugged in, it will stay on one single line.  In blocks of text, the Template Tag is repeated over and over again, to demonstrate when and where the paragraph will be continued on the next line.
b) Make sure your text isn’t too long for the text line or block.
When your text is plugged in to the template, text that is too long will be cut off or will extend beyond the area it should.  Shorten or reduce your text if it seems too long.  If you estimate on the short side, you should be safe and the sheet will have more white space, which makes it easier to read.  (One benefit of using spreadsheets is that the spreadsheet could tell you when your text was too long.  I could include maximum word counts in sample outlines, if it would help.)
c) Add a Template Tag to the beginning of each line in the outline.

After the number or letter in the outline, add the Template Tag and a semicolon.  Do not add a space after the semicolon.  Make sure you use the same capitalization as in the Template Tag.
As you can see in this example, a Template Tag precedes each line of text that will be replace the placeholder text in the Template.


d) Email A.M.P. Producer finished outline.

After you email the A.M.P. Producer the finished outline and the list of images and any documents, the A.M.P. Producer will return a hand-out and the presentation software for the next step.


Step 4 – Record Script Based on Presentation

Most Important Guides
Don’t be afraid to be conversational – this voice layer adds the human tone – taking the information provided and applying it to real life.
Multiple voices are preferred – makes it easier to edit because one person isn’t responsible for all of the voice-over; is more inclusive; can be more interesting to listen to; allows more people to record voice-over (the longer you listen to a voice, the more important the voice is professional)

How-to
a) Open A.M.P. Presentation emailed to you by the A.M.P. Producer
Open the A.M.P. Presentation in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox (not Internet Explorer).  One way you can do this is to open Google Chrome and then drag the file into the status bar of Google Chrome.  You can also right click the file name and Choose “Open with...” and then pick Google Chrome.
You can navigate  through the presentation with the arrow keys.  Right or down will proceed to the next frame, up or left will go back to the previous frame.  Also, you can proceed to the next frame by clicking on the window and you can go back with the backspace button on your keyboard or smartphone.
For example, here are three consecutive frames from a presentation.

       
b) For each frame, write a script for the voice-over for that frame.
Write a short voice-over script for each frame, and use the number in the upper left hand corner as a reference.  You don’t want to just read the text in the frame.  Put the ideas in the text into a conversational tone.  You can include brief examples.  In fact, you can try to skip this step and record without a script. Recording without a script could make natural-sounding, conversational voice-over.
c) Record yourself or others reading that frame’s script on a smartphone.
Find a smartphone with a voice recorder app and a somewhat quiet area.  Test the recorder by recording a sound check and playing it back.  If the recording sounds good, record the script for a single frame.
d) Save the audio file as “audio-NN.mp3”, where NN is the number of the frame in two digits.
If the voice recorder app lets you change the format and filename for the audio file, choose MP3 and name the file “audio-NN.mp3”.  NN stand for the number of the frame using two digits – 01, 02, 10... For example, audio for the above frames would be saved as “audio-04.mp3”, “audio-05.mp3”, and “audio-06.mp3”.
Do You Want to Write The Script Earlier?
As mentioned in Step 1, it may help to write the voice-over script at the same time you are writing the text for the hand-out and video.  It can be easier to write these at the same time – as you cutting down a title or the text, you can add that information to the voice-over script, where you don’t have such tight restraints.
To include audio in your original outline, add this after the number in the outline “AVAudioNN” where NN is the two digit frame number.  If you would like a list of frames for the template you pick before you start your outline, email the A.M.P. Producer.
Step 6 – Add Images, Animations and Videos
The benefit of A.M.P. for video production is that A.M.P. creates a basic framework for a video.  The video will look like the A.M.P. presentation that was emailed to you.  The video will advance to the next frame when the audio recorded for that frame is finished.  This allows advocates to not have to think or worry about video for every frame.  You can focus on making or finding the images, animations and videos that will be the most useful for clients
  
Most Important Guides
1. Pick images, animations or videos that create more familiarity. 
2. Find simple ways  People are watching this for information, not educational value

How to
a) As you are adding audio frame-by-frame, find frames where you would like to add images, animations or videos.
b) Make or find the additions that you want.

OPTIONS
1. Screen capture video  It is very easy and also very helpful to make a video by recording your desktop when you need to show the client how to use an online database or type a letter.  We can request I.T. to install a screen recorder program.  Until then, you can request an A.M.P. producer to make screen capture videos. 
2. Images. You could take images of courthouses, agency buildings, or other locations that a client may have to be familiar with.
a. Zoom or pan (moving the camera across the image) can be added to an image to add emphasis or make it more lively.  For example, you could zoom into a part of a form you are discussing.
b. A series of images can be used for a dialogue, like Connecticut Legal Services videos, or to show some process, such as walking into the clerk’s office.
c. You can take your own pictures or you can search online.  If you find an image online, make sure that we are allowed to use the image, meaning the image must be public domain or licensed under Creative Commons.  To be safe, email the A.M.P. Producer where you found the image and the license.
3. Animations made by Powerpoint or other programs.  Simple animations can be made by Powerpoint.  In addition, there are websites that help you make short animations.
4. Video from public domain films.  Films made before the 1940s are in the public domain and can be used.  You can look at websites like the Internet Archive to find public domain films.  It can be very difficult to find inclusive video made 80 years ago, but I’ve used a Buster Keaton slapstick video about poor housing conditions.
5. Video from your smart phone.  Like audio, the quality of a video clip is more important the longer the clip is.  Since we are using short clips for each frame, smart phone-quality video is good enough for our purposes. 
6. Reuse old images, animations or videos  As we make more videos, we will build a library of images, animations and videos that we can reuse.  You can watch existing videos to see if anything we used before could be used again. 

c) Upload your additions to the G: drive and email an A.M.P. Producer.
